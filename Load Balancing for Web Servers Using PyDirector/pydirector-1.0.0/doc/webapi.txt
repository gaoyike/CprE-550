This is a list of all current and planned web calls. Ones
marked with 'unimplemented' in the text are, well, unimplemented.
Ones marked with [maybe] are tentative and may not be implemented.

Information/Configuration
-------------------------

  - running 

      current configuration and status of the PD (HTML)
      this page is the GUI for interactively editing the pydir
      config.

  - running.txt 

      simple text view of the current running config. suitable
      for simple reading by programs

  - config.xml - 

      initial boot-time configuration of the PD (xml)

  - running.xml

      current running config of the PD (xml)

  - [maybe] config / config.txt ?

      is there a use for text view of boot time config? not really.
      unimplemented.

  - [maybe] config vs. running

      a display of what's different between boot time and current
      config. unimplemented.

  - [maybe] reload config, making changes

      some sort of smart reload that painlessly reloads the config
      and switches in the various new bits without interruption. will
      probably do this as a seperate program that uses the webapi to
      do this, instead. unimplemented.

Host management
---------------

  - addHost?service=NNN&group=NNN&name=NNNN&ip=NNN:n 

      add a new host to the group of a service

  - delHost?service=NNN&group=NNN&name=NNN

      remove a host from the group of a service
      Note that this will not let you remove all hosts
      from the enabled group.

  - delAllHosts?service=NNN&group=NNN 

      remove all hosts from the group of a service. unimplemented
      Note that this will not let you remove all hosts
      from the enabled group. 

Group management
----------------

  - enableGroup?service=NNN&group=NNN -

      switch the currently enabled group. Note that this will
      not affect any in-progress connections. The existing enabled
      group.

  - changeScheduler?service=NNN&group=NNN&scheduler=NNN

      change the scheduler of a group. This will not allow you to
      change the scheduer of an enabled group. unimplemented.

User management
---------------

  - addUser?name=NNNN&password=NNNN&access=NNNN

      add a new user to the web admin interface. unimplemented.

  - delUser?name=NNNN

  - newService?service=NNN&listen=NNN

      add a new service. unimplemented.

  - newGroup?service=NNN&group=NNN&scheduler=NNN

      close and re-open the log file. unimplemented.

  - retryHost?service=NNN&group=NNN&host=NNN

      force the manager thread to re-add a host now. unimplemented.

  - hostAdminDown?service=NNN&group=NNN&name=NNN 

      mark a host as 'administratively down'. This disables it,
      without removing it from the configuration. unimplemented.

  - hostAdminUp?service=NNN&group=NNN&name=NNN 

      mark a host as 'administratively up'. This re-enables it,
      assuming it's been previously marked 'down'. unimplemented.
